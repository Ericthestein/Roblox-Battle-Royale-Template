# Roblox-Battle-Royale-Template

A template for creating a game of the popular battle royale genre. Games made with this template can be easily published to Roblox.com and/or be used to quickly iterate through ideas for battle royale games on other platforms.

This template can also be found at https://www.roblox.com/games/2850063392/Battle-Royale-Template.

## Usage

### Customizing Variables

Once you download the file, open it in Roblox Studio. Open ServerScriptService to find, "Main Game Loop," the script controlling the game. From here, you can change several global variables, such as the length of time of the intermission and the number of players necessary to begin the match.

### Adding Weapons

Add your own weapons by dragging them into the, "Weapons" folder in ServerStorage.

### Customizing The Drop Ship

To edit the dropship, move, "Plane" from ServerStorage to Workspace. Once you are complete, ensure that it has its PrimaryPart set and that you move it back into ServerStorage.

### Changing UI

To change the UI, navigate to StarterGui; from there, you can customize the sizes, positions, colors, etc. of the children of the, "Game Info" ScreenGui.
